    <h3>Founded - 1790 America's First Flour Company Is Founded </h3>
        <p>There were 13 states in the new United States. George Washington was America's first president. 
           And Henry Wood began importing flour from England, establishing his business at Boston's Long Wharf. 
           Henry Wood & Company, the original ancestor of King Arthur Baking Company, was the first flour company in the young United States â€” 
           and first food company in New England.</p>
           <p>We begin milling flour from American-grown wheat. As American farmers moved west, wheat farming flourished. 
            A more bountiful wheat supply, along with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, 
            made it possible for Henry Wood & Company to stop its English wheat imports and begin selling American-milled flour.</p>
            <p>Gold was discovered in northern California in 1848, and the rush was on. Hungry miners developed naturally fermented "sourdough" as a way to bake bread. 
            And in 1849, The French Bakery became the first shop in San Francisco offering sourdough bread for sale.</p>
            <p>The Sands, Taylor, & Wood Company introduced its "new and improved" flour at the Boston Food Fair, naming it King Arthur for its Arthurian attributes: 
            "purity, loyalty, honesty, superior strength, and a dedication to a higher purpose."</p>
